# Analysis 1 - Mythologizing the French Revolution (Briana)

The French Revolution inaugurated the nineteenth-century, fundamentally shaping the distribution of powers in modern democratic states with the end of feudalism and positioning “the people” as the highest political authority [^1] [^2]. Emerging from the Revolution, conceptualizations of “progress” and the struggle against absolutism became the defining features of a rapidly industrializing Europe with various groups co-opting Revolutionary ideals and traditions for self-legitimation [^3]. The revolutionary tradition in nineteenth-century Europe was, then, an ambiguous heritage which political groups could appropriate and envision a proper society either past or present through mythmaking and production of popular culture which utilized imagery and language from the Revolution to claim inheritance of its ideals. 

Individualism and meritocracies were critical structures born from the Revolution, the latter being particularly effective in driving the nobility and aristocracy out with those remaining attempting to build a new regime through mythmaking, royalist populism, and the glamorization of life prior to the Revolution [^4] [^5] [^6]. Myth, in the context of the revolutionary tradition, does not refer to a false belief but rather a narrative that conveys a particular vision of society and historical representations formed by the groups propagating these accounts [^7]. For royalist aristocrats and clerical allies who operated through particularism and defense of traditional culture, mythmaking centered on idyllic visions of countries such as Germany who were still beholden to local nobles and medieval manors [^8]. Clergy members capitalized on religious persecution following the September massacres of 1792 and de-Christianization among certain bourgeoisie and government members to create martyr narratives, especially in rural France where religion was an integral factor in community life and routine [^9]. Mythmaking in royalist and religious circles centered on traditional and legal “orders” in pre-Revolutionary Europe that categorized society by states, arising from fear of the violence of the Revolution [^10]. Conservatism as an ideology was defined by this fear, dedicated to the restoration of the old regime through figures such as Edmund Burke who appealed to those searching for a sense of stability amidst a rapidly changing century. Russia was plagued by various economic problems which brought issues of change and conservatism to the forefront and questions of whether it would be possible to adopt a liberal democracy following the Revolution [^11]. Austria, Prussia, and Russia exploited fears of liberalism to legitimize their autocracies and conservative employers attempted to build family-oriented atmospheres to maintain loyalty [^12]. The “Metternich System” placed an inflexibility on conservative thought in idealizing pre-revolutionary structures, which was too strict and criticized upon inception, particularly by those on the left [^13]. 

Amidst the diminishing influence of the nobility, the French Revolution gave way to a new French middle class which dominated the collective consciousness of European society to the point of referring to the century as the “Age of the Bourgeoisie.” [^14] [^15]. The bourgeoisie were the main beneficiaries of the French Revolution which established private landownership but were particularly concerned over the lower-class and socialism which espoused public ownership of the means of production including land [^16]. Utopian socialists were critical of individualism and favored cooperation over competition with Count Henri de Saint-Simon, the first utopian socialist, stating that those who maximized production should be rewarded more heavily than those who simply owned the most [^17]. Studying the utopian socialists and histories of the French Revolution, Karl Marx connected class and organization of people based on industrial economy in his approach of historical materialism in which history is a product of class antagonisms [^18] [^19]. Representations of history were, then, a concern for much of Marx’s work such as The 18th Brumaire of Louis Napoleon which directly targeted mythmaking in groups conjuring “the spirits of the past to their service,” where the Revolution of 1848 parodied that of 1789 [^20]. Marx was fascinated by the French Revolution however the revolutionary process was undoubtedly a bourgeois revolution which “abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property.” [^21]. In ascribing bourgeois properties, Marx could discuss the necessity of a new, Communist revolution which would fulfill the imperfections of the French Revolution. 

The latter half of the nineteenth-century, especially after the relaxation of censorship laws in 1881, bore witness to an upheaval of the visual arts which capitalized on notions of popular sovereignty that emphasized the significance of “mass mobilizations,” particularly amongst the peasantry [^22] [^23]. Anarchism was especially attractive to artists as many key thinkers, such as Petr Kropotkin, Russian prince and geologist, attached a critical significance to the role of artists in exposing the inequities of society to the lower-class [^24]. Anarchist theory stood for absolute individualism and abhorred organizational structures which positioned the movement on the fringes of political society. To combat this, anarchists drew from popular culture of the French Revolution which became a vehicle to push their revolutionary agenda to a wider audience [^25]. Anarchists were particularly enamored with the culture of the sans-culottes, desiring to become the anonymous revolutionary minority that would incentivize the masses to political action [^26]. Thus, the anarchists focused on graphic representations that were often symbolic of class warfare, depicting the working-class as miserable or formidable avengers and the bourgeoisie and associated allies as obese and cruel [^27]. For instance, in response to French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau’s violent suppression of the Draveil-Villeneuve-Saint-Georges strikes, Parisian magazine Les Hommes du Jour published an issue in January 1908 depicting Clemenceau with his head waving on a pike [^28]. Stating that Clemenceau wore the costume of Robespierre, anarcho-communist Victor Méric asserted that the legacy of the Revolution was a “frock,” drawing attention to the failures of the French Revolution in a manner that was accessible to the lower-classes through caricature.

The French Revolution in nineteenth-century Europe was exploited by the various political groups that arose from the political turbulence, either drawing inspiration from or fearing the changes that developed in its aftermath. Conservative groups such as the royalists or clergy members idealized the pre-revolutionary social order and were defined by a strict rigidity that opposed political change. In contrast, left-leaning movements such as the socialists or Marxists were eager to envision a society free from oppression, often criticizing the Revolution as an imperfect experiment which enabled an exploitative bourgeois class to rule over the people. On either side of the spectrum, transmissions from the past allowed groups to appropriate aspects of the Revolution to validate political objectives and visualize a particular image of what society ought to be.


# Analysis 2 - Impact on Social Groups (Nicole)

The French Revolution transformed the ways in which social groups like the nobility, clergy, and women navigated and conceived of their places in the new nation. Regardless of the differences in their initial reactions to the Revolution, these social groups all adapted to revolutionary ideals and adopted some of its language over time.

Generally, French nobility and clergymen both initially opposed the Revolution, as they enjoyed certain social privileges in the ancién regime. For example, although nobles’ wealth varied, they were generally landed and oftentimes held a governmental or military post [^29]. During the revolutionary period, many nobles (known as “emigres”) fled France, mostly of their own volition to avoid persecution. The revolution also alarmed nobility across Europe, who feared the possible spread of the revolution’s ideals in their home countries that would disrupt their ways of life and make them lose their privileges. However, after the revolution, some emigres came back, and they began to adopt more meritocratic language and practices in order to adapt to the new social order. As for the clergy, they had to contend with the Revolution’s efforts to control the Church and reduce its societal supremacy. Although some of the clergy were alarmed by revolutionaries’ demands, others initially cooperated with revolutionary religious policies such as pledging allegiance to the state under the Civil Constitution of 1790. Priests who did take this oath did so because they thought that cultivating a “reputation for patriotism” would help protect the Church’s influence among the public [^30]. Nonetheless, the Reign of Terror saw the persecution of clergymen and the suppression of public Catholic worship, fundamentally altering the role of religion in French society even though most people remained religious.  No longer enjoying the privileges of the estate system, the Church had to adapt to a post-revolutionary religious order– specifically, the Concordat of 1801 reestablished peace and religious liberty in France, but the clergy had to accept that Catholicism would no longer be the official state religion. Even though most French people remained Catholic, the Church no longer had unchallenged societal supremacy, so it had to adapt to revolutionary ideals of a more secularized French nation that had some separation from the Church. Hence, the Revolution popularized ideals of meritocracy, loyalty to the nation, and secularization that the nobility and clergy had to adapt to in order to remain relevant in the emerging 19th-century social order.

Moreover, women played a significant role in the French Revolution but were excluded from its goals and regarded with contempt if they participated too directly. Through spreading revolutionary ideals, they were able to participate in public life in new ways. Many French women made pamphlets, organized petitions, and participated in political clubs for revolutionary causes [^31]. However, although mainstream revolutionaries pushed for universal male suffrage, they maintained that the feminine ideal consisted of motherhood and domesticity, so notions of equality did not extend to women. Female activists were hence often viewed with suspicion even if they held mainstream revolutionary views. For instance, Parisian women formed a crucial and dedicated part of Robespierre’s support base, with many going as far as wearing his likeness and publicly booing his opponents’ speeches [^32]. Notably, Robespierre’s female supporters did not push for gender equality, but they were still not welcomed as revolutionary actors; leaders after the Thermidorian Reaction used Robespierre’s popularity with women as a way to mock him, and even Robespierre himself did not support women’s rights. In a speech, he warned of the dangers of the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, mischaracterizing them as wanting men to submit to an all-female Senate and Presidency [^33]. So, even opposing factions of society widely agreed that women were not suited for equal participation in political life during and after the Revolution.

Still, the French Revolution opened up opportunities for women to create political identities for themselves and push for their rights as citizens. For instance, citizens who commissioned portraits post-revolution used them as a means to represent themselves as virtuous citizens in unity with the state [^34]. One woman who successfully did this was Thérésia Cabarrus, a prominent socialite whose prison correspondence helped spur the Thermidorian Reaction [^35]. The portrait uses revolutionary imagery– such as holding hair that was freshly cut to prepare her for execution– to convey Cabarrus as an important political actor. In this sense, the Revolution opened up new pathways for women like Cabbarus to represent themselves as capable and influential participants in political life. The Revolution’s ideals similarly expanded women’s conceptions of selfhood during the Revolution of 1848, with some women arguing that it had re-established the French Revolution’s ideals of “liberty, equality, and fraternity… And rights could not be denied to women if the Republic was to be consistent with its own principles,” [^36]. Women in the Third Republic similarly drew on the French Revolution’s Enlightenment ideals by arguing for their rights on the basis of being rational individuals [^37]. Therefore, French women during and after the Revolution used its concepts of rationality, equality, and citizenship to challenge the patriarchal structures that dismissed their capacity to serve as serious actors in the political realm of the nation.

However, the French Revolution also discouraged women from fighting for suffrage due to fears of being punished or destabilizing the new nation. For instance, Olympe de Gouges fiercely supported the revolution’s ideals of human rights but was disillusioned at the failure to extend them to women. In The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen, de Gouges responds to women’s exclusion from the original document, affirming the importance of the nation like other revolutionaries did, while also diverging from the mainstream by arguing that women are “born free and [remain] equal to [men] in rights,” [^38]. By adopting revolutionary language of citizenship and natural rights but appropriating it for the purpose of gender equality, mainstream revolutionaries viewed her as a subversive force, ultimately executing her during the Reign of Terror. The fate of de Gouges and other female activists (branded as counterrevolutionaries) profoundly impacted how women approached their societal role in the 19th century. Women were expected to remain in the separate sphere of domesticity, away from politics. Republican women worried subverting this norm would cause turmoil in the fragile republic, so they chose to focus their agenda on civil rights and gradual improvement in living conditions rather than on women’s suffrage outright [^39]. European women elsewhere were also inspired by the ideals of the Revolution, but France’s repeated political upheaval made French women particularly concerned about undermining the republic by pushing too hard for suffrage.


# Analysis 3 - Economic Impact (Andie)

Looking at the French Revolution through an economic lens is extremely important in understanding the French Revolution itself, as well as its vast impact on France and Europe as a whole throughout the 19th century. 

To begin, the American Revolution beginning in 1775 had a large impact on France’s finances and was arguably a reason behind the French Revolution, as France went into bankruptcy about 6 years after the American Revolution [^40]. Specifically, French leaders such as Jacques Necker, who was in charge of royal finances from 1776-1781, contributed finances for the American Revolution without raising taxes on the French people, raising concern as to where this money came from. All in all, the French government spent over 1 billion livres bankrolling the American Revolution, which largely came from taking out loans from the city of Paris, the Clergy, and Provincial Estates [^41]. Not only did the French provide monetary assistance, the French also provided troops and other material aid as well. This essentially pushed the debt problem/ loan repayment down the line and while it did prevent France from spiraling into crippling debt, France was still not increasing its revenue streams. Following this, King Louis XVI sent America two million additional livres, with no terms attached. Concurrently, America was also in a large amount of debt, and America used the money from the French to repay the interest on the loans that had been lent from Americans out of fear of the country crumbling. Additionally, there were no explicit terms of the French loan, so there was ambiguity as to when the loan would have to be repaid as well as how much would have to be repaid. Following the American victory, French leader Calonne, the new financial minister continued to spend and put France in further debt, which was compounded by America’s lack of fully repaying the loans borrowed from the French due to the ambiguity of the terms. Thus, the debt incurred from assisting the United States in the American Revolution, as well as the Seven Years’ War, together with the poor economic decisions from Calonne put France into immense debt, which in turn was a major catalyst of the French Revolution.

To continue, capitalism played a significant role in the French Revolution because it exacerbated the tensions between classes and their inequalities. Capitalism in particular intensified the gaps between the working class, bourgeoisie, and aristocracy because the bourgeoisie was able to expand their wealth under the capitalist framework, echoing a theme across Europe during the 19th century. However, the lack of social capital as well as their perception of the lack of representation the bourgeoisie possessed led to an increase in revolutionary talk/feelings which eventually led to the start of the French Revolution, as well as tension between the different classes. Further, capitalism penetrated into the agricultural sector, which in turn caused food instability. This was coupled with bad harvests, which raised food prices even higher and contributed to an increase in poverty. The government was incapable of controlling the fluctuating prices, which led to more riots and dissatisfaction with the French government as well as the new economic order. Further, commercialism and industrialization further intensified the inequalities, showing how the economy is deeply intertwined with social relations as well. Another reason contributing to this was the redistribution of land. Beginning with the law passed on November 2, 1789, allowed the French government to confiscate land belonging to the clergy and the aristocracy in order to generate money, which allowed members of other social classes such as the bourgeoisie to acquire the land, although they did not gain political capital along with this. Additionally, the Third Estate was heavily taxed whereas the aristocracy was not, which was another inequality that contributed to the increased dissatisfaction of the French government at this time. 

Furthermore, continuing into the 19th century, after the revolution’s start in 1789, France experienced hyperinflation due to the vast amount of funds needed to support the war declared on Austria in 1792. The French Revolution changed the way that currency was viewed in terms of land ownership, capital, and wealth, producing lasting financial effects not only throughout the 19th century but even today. Most prominently, the development of paper currency as well as its mass printing produced mass amounts of hyperinflation because of the devaluation of the currency. The French government issued “assignats”, which in turn led to hyperinflation due to the economic disruption. As hyperinflation did not occur until after the French Revolution, it can be seen as a long-lasting effect of the French Revolution, calling for reform and change within the government. Along with this, the Revolution shifted the French economy from a feudal economy to a capitalist market economy by decreasing the power of controls on commerce, which in turn expanded the bourgeoisie and was furthered by Napoleon’s rule later in the 19th century. The abolition of feudalism led to greater economic mobility and social flexibility, which many believe was a positive effect of the French Revolution, as it got rid of the restrictive obligations that feudalism purported.

The economic impact leading up to the French Revolution and the legacy it left behind is extremely important in understanding the significance of the French Revolution. Although a combination of political, social, and economic factors is ultimately what caused the French Revolution, it is critical to understand economic factors because of their long-lasting impact on the future of France, domestically and internationally.
