# Introduction (Zoe)

The French Revolution was one of a kind, at the time. Europe was ruled by the aristocracy and monarchies with little regard for the lower classes. France was no exception with their absolute monarch and the estate system – the first (nobility), the second (clergy), and third (commoners) estates respectively that disproportionately favored the first two estates. The French Revolution emerged from a period of intense social and political strain experienced by the Third Estate. Decades of economic hardship from bad harvests and intense taxes from wars fought, social inequality, and political corruption heightened tensions among the lower class. This discontent sparked an uprising in 1789, resulting in the overthrow of the monarchy, the establishment of a republic, and a radical restructuring of French society that carried on into the 19th century with the rise of Napoleon. 

Although the Revolution itself was marked by violence and complicated shifts in power, its impact was far-reaching, bringing both hope and caution, not just in France but across Europe. For the first time, the lower class and other marginalized groups believed in something more; and at the same time, monarchs feared for their standing and power. In the years following, the Revolution continued to resonate, leaving a legacy and impact on nineteenth-century Europe. Its political, economic, and social ideals were appropriated and reacted to by the rest of the continent throughout the century. The French Revolution was shaped not only by immediate political and economic landscapes but growing issues – the Revolution’s legacy fueled lasting ideological movements and economic shifts in Europe throughout the nineteenth century.
