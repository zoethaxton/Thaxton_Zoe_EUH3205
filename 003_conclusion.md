# Conclusion (Katia)

European monarchy did not instantly end with King Louis XVIâ€™s execution, but the French Revolution was the first, shocking step toward continental populism. While the democratic ideals of the Revolution were short-lived, the French people succeeded in overthrowing a long-established monarchy. This relative success spilled into other European countries and inspired widespread calls for reform and new governance.

The overturning of the status quo influenced new philosophical thought, reconsidering egalitarianism, individual liberty, and democracy as realistic ideals. The rise of Marxism, for instance, saw the people as a source of power and the rightful rulers of society rather than dynastic leaders. However, the French Revolution also gave rise to a counter-movement that fought to preserve tradition, conservatism, and monarchy as the European norm. The Congress of Vienna, led by conservative Prince Klemens von Metternich, exemplifies the attempt to keep populism at bay. France herself shows the long struggle between authoritarianism and democracy. Alternating between populist French Republics, Bonaparte emperors, and even another Bourbon king, France reflects the power struggle of the 19th century between conservative and progressive ideals.

Before 1789, nearly every European nation was headed by an absolute monarch. Today, only twelve remain, all with significantly diminished power. While the democratization of Europe would extend into the 19th century and beyond, the French Revolution indisputably placed Europeans on a path that would end traditional monarchy on the continent forever.
